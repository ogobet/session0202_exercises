1) This program returns the following:
	IT'S SO LOUD
	20

2) get_louder method defines and assign a value to a variable called loudness, prints out a message; "IT'S SO LOUD", then returns the value of loudness =20

3) loudness =10 ; because this variable remains untouched outside the method get_louder. Hence it is a completely new variable 
accesed outside the method
